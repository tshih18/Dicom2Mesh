# DicomToMesh

DicomToMesh is a handy command line tool, which enables the user to automatically create a 3D mesh from a set of 2D DICOM images, a common image format used in medicine. The supported 3D mesh formats are STL, OBJ and PLY.

# Mesh Creation

The 3D surface mesh is computed by the marching cubes algorithm. As an input, this algorithm requires a threshold which indicates what range of voxel values should be considered. This threshold is also known as iso-value. In CT scans, the iso-value depends on the tissue (density). In Dicom2Mesh you can specify the iso-value with the parameter <code>-t X</code>, where X is an integer.

# Mesh Post-Processing Options

**Mesh reduction:** The mesh of a medical DICOM image can easily exceed 1 GB of data. Reducing the number of polygons, therefore, is a crucial feature. Reduction can be enabled by the option <code>-r X</code> where X is a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0.

**Mesh smoothing:** Acquired medical images contain often heavy noise. This is visible in the extracted 3D surface. Smoothing the mesh leads often to a better result. Smoothing can be enabled with the argument <code>-s</code>.

**Remove small objects:** The resulting 3D mesh contains often parts which are not of interest, such as for example the screws of the table on which a CT scan of a patient was acquired. With DicomToMesh, you can remove objects below a certain size by adding the option <code>-e X</code> where X is a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0. <code>X</code> is a size threshold relative to the connected object with the most vertices. It is easy understandable with an example: The biggest connected object of the mesh has 1000 vertices. Then <code>-e 0.25</code> removes all connected objects with less than 250 vertices.

# Visualisation 

By passing the command line option <code>-v</code> the resulting mesh is visualised in a 3D environment. By double clicking the mesh's  surface, the corresponding 3D coordinate is printed to the shell.

# Building

The software is written in C++11 and uses VTK 7.0. CMake is used as build-system.

Building DicomToMesh on Linux:
```
> git clone https://github.com/AOT-AG/DicomToMesh.git</code>
> cd DicomToMesh
> mkdir build
> cd build
> ccmake ..  #opens ccmake window
```
Within the ccmake window, pass the path to your vtk installation or vtk build directory. In my case, it looks like that
```
BUILD_GUI                        OFF
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                 DEBUG
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /usr/local                                   
USE_VTK_DICOM                    OFF                                          
VTK_DIR                          /home/eidelen/Development/libs/vtk/build     
```
Press <code>c</code> and then <code>g</code>. 
Now you are back in terminal and ready to build.
```
> make
```

In order to extend the supported DICOM formats, the libray vtk-dicom <code>USE_VTK_DICOM</code> can be optionally enabled (see https://github.com/dgobbi/vtk-dicom).

# How to use Dicom2Mesh

Command line arguments can be combined and passed in arbitrary order.

**Input and output:** The path to the DICOM directory is passed by the argument <code>-i dicomPath</code>. The file name of the resulting 3D mesh is specified by the parameter <code>-o meshPath</code>. This simple example transforms a DICOM data set into a 3D mesh file called mesh.stl, by using an iso-value of 557 <code>-t 557</code>. 

<code>> dicom2mesh -i pathToDicomDirectory -t 557 -o mesh.stl</code>

Alternatively, one can use an existing 3d mesh as input. This is useful if you want to apply only mesh post-processing routines and bypass the time consuming mesh creation step. This example imports the former mesh.stl, centers it and exports it in the OBJ mesh format.

<code>> dicom2mesh -i mesh.stl -c -o newMesh.obj</code>

**Mesh post-processing:** The following example shows different mesh post-processing methods applied to resulting surface mesh out of the marching cubes algorithm. In particular, a mesh is reduced by 90% of its original number faces <code>-r 0.9</code>. In addition, the mesh is smoothed <code>-s</code> and centred at the coordinate system's origin <code>-c</code>.  Another helpful function is the removal of small objects - here the removal of every object smaller than 5% of the biggest object <code>-e 0.05</code>.

<code>> dicom2mesh -i pathToDicomDirectory -r 0.9 -s -c -e 0.05 -o mesh.stl</code>

# GUI

Dicom2Mesh can be built with a small GUI on top.
This showed up to be helpful for users without command line experience.
However, the control possibilities are limited compared to the command line version.

<p align="center"><img alt="dicom2mesh_gui" src="http://eidelen.diffuse.ch/dicomtomesh_gui2.png" width="75%"></p>

In order to build the Dicom2Mesh GUI, please set the cmake flag <code>BUILD_GUI=ON</code> when configuring the project.
The GUI requires QT.

DicomToMesh is a small in-house product of AOT AG (http://www.aot.swiss). Since it is based on several open-source examples, we decided to make our code public as well. We hope somebody can use parts of it. Participants are most welcome.

Have fun :)
